"By the way, if the translator program did not attach value to the maximum size of the executable code, then for the virtual machine this parameter has a value and cannot exceed 682 bytes:"
does this mean some .cor file might not have prog_size data?
//ask miriam

//fix ./corewar moro.cor 1

//either tidy them up into one or two structs or remake them as global,
but player need to be remade since its needed to still be in header for assembler?


these needs to be tested
Jyris checklist:
add, works
Sub, works
and,or,xor works
lldi,
zjmp,workss
lld, works atleast on direct, indirect value


fork == done
check zjmp to see if it still works == seems to be working, according to my tests

handle game.live_performed and the actual game looping (in corewar() )
//trying to handle it with while (game->head) exists, so we know there is still atleast carriage?

jyri:
AFF works, as simple way as possible. we have to figure out how to make it work with the flags (needs to be passed as argument now...)

NEXT:
-game looping;
	1. game has to check carriages every time current cycle is > CYCLE_TO_DIE
	2. game should loop only until game->head is deleted. (try to implement)
	3. fix the process deletions, now segfault when trying to free last process? (should we also pass the game as argument?)
	4. new variable needs to be implemented to process to delete dead process when live was called more than CYCLE_TO_DIE cycles back? (this might already be fixed)
-Test the instructions;
	1. better testing on zjmp (but it seems like working)
	2. test with all provided files that actual instructions does what needed
