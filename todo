"By the way, if the translator program did not attach value to the maximum size of the executable code, then for the virtual machine this parameter has a value and cannot exceed 682 bytes:"
does this mean some .cor file might not have prog_size data?
//ask miriam

these needs to be tested
Jyris checklist:
add, works
Sub, works
and,or,xor works
lldi,
zjmp,workss
lld, works atleast on direct, indirect value


jyri:
AFF works, as simple way as possible. we have to figure out how to make it work with the flags (needs to be passed as argument now...)

NEXT:
-game looping;
	4. new variable needs to be implemented to process to delete dead process when live was called more than CYCLE_TO_DIE cycles back? (this might already be fixed)
-Test the instructions;
	1. better testing on zjmp (but it seems like working)



------->	 test with all provided files that actual instructions does what needed
