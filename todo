"By the way, if the translator program did not attach value to the maximum size of the executable code, then for the virtual machine this parameter has a value and cannot exceed 682 bytes:"
does this mean some .cor file might not have prog_size data?
//ask miriam

//fix ./corewar moro.cor 1

//either tidy them up into one or two structs or remake them as global,
but player need to be remade since its needed to still be in header for assembler?


these needs to be tested
Jyris checklist:
add, works
Sub, works
and,or,xor works
lldi,
zjmp,workss
lld, works atleast on direct, indirect value


fork == done
check zjmp to see if it still works == seems to be working, according to my tests

handle game.live_performed and the actual game looping (in corewar() )

jyri:
AFF works, as simple way as possible. we have to figure out how to make it work with the flags (needs to be passed as argument now...)
