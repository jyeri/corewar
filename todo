problem text in test file is because their dumb test are using -d flag on given vm and -dump flags on own. remember to modify the script.
	1. Make sure the flag 8 is functional? there might be something. (and make flags until 25?)
	2. make new script that instead of just rewriting the results, it writes error messages and error dumps in separate files.
	3. moulinette ofc.
	4. keep on testing with random combination of champions (but at the time of testing no error in -v4)
